JSONS Q1 QUESTION:
: Where do you go shopping?

JSON Q1 OPTIONS:

A: The farmers' market: it's the furthest away with mid-price produce. You would be supporting farmers and getting high-quality fresh produce, but they might not have everything you need.

B: The specialty store: it's a bit further away and more expensive but has all products you need, and you would be supporting a local sustainable business.

C: The supermarket chain: it's cheaper, closest to your apartment and is guaranteed to have all products and ingredients you need, but they are less transparent about their products.


JSON Q1 TRADEOFFS:

A TITLE: Emma's Choice: The Farmers' Market
A TEXT: I contributed directly to farmers and chose fresh, seasonal food with a lower environmental footprint. It did take more time, though, and I needed a second stop to complete my list.

B TITLE: Emma's Choice: The Specialty Store
B TEXT: I supported a local business with sustainable practices and good quality products. It did take a while to travel there and was on the pricier side, which makes it harder to maintain.

C TITLE: Emma's Choice: The Supermarket
C TEXT: I saved time and money with a convenient one-stop shop. However, my choices did support long supply chains and less transparent, industrial production.
