[1] CHARACTER BIO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSON:
  Emma, 28, lives in the city and works at an NGO with a focus on the environment. She enjoys cooking and browsing secondhand shops. Her friends come from all walks of life, and they often get into thoughtful (and fun) conversations about values, choices, and the world around them. Raised in the inner city, Emma enjoys exploring local markets and learning about how products are made as she has limited experience with how farming and food production looks like in the countryside.
