She has 20 years of experience in policy and has served multiple constituencies. Clara is pragmatic and aware of the many competing interests that food policy must balance: farmers' livelihoods, consumers' concerns, environmental goals, international trade obligations, and budget constraints. She knows that designing effective policy requires understanding diverse perspectives.",
